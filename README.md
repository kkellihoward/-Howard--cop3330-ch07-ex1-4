# Welcome to Calculator App
* The calculator can do powers, square root functions, simply addition and subtraction
* Program can take in decimals, negative numbers(except for sqrt of negative numbers), positive numbers
* User can type a number/variable +/- a number/variable and program will print answer 
* The calculator allows user to define variables:
  * Use "let" to define a variable that can be changed... ex: let x = 3
  * User can change variable value by typing the name followed by an equal sign and the new wanted value (do not reuse "let" to change the value)... ex: x=4
  * Use "const" to declare a variable that can not be changed after its defined... ex: const x = 3 (defines x as 3 for the rest of program)
* Use "sqrt(*number/variable*)" to calculate the square root of number... ex: let x = 4 (\n), sqrt(x) to calculate
* User can define more than one variable and do calculations... ex: const x=3, (\n) const y=4 (\n), x+y and program will print answer
* User can calculate powers by typing "pow(*x,i*)" which multiplies the x with itself i times... ex: pow(2,3) which would print 8
  * pow(*x,i*) can not take in variables, only integers
# You are now ready to use program!
